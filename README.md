# ZeldaRecipes
App to find what can be made from ingredients

I want to make a python project that does the following:
1) Takes an input of a photo of Zelda Ingreditents tab
2) Converts that to a lJSON of "Ingredient name, Image, Quantity"
3) Based on the forumula of attributes categorises them
4) Determines the unique permutations of recipies available
5) Gives the attributwes relavent to Zelda that the recipies give (Health, Stamina, Status etc.)
